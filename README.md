## Project's description
> The broken line L is constructed of n-1 sections between n points
L = ((x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xi, yi), ..., (xn, yx)). Visualization of such a line is not always
is advantageous, because excess points can strongly darken the image. Therefore
only some points will be visualized. This must be done in such a way that the error between
the original broken line and the approximation was as small as possible. Algorithm of
zooming is conceptually known. In the project 2D visualization of approximation of the broken line is required.

## Instruction to launch the program 
1. Clone the repository - open the command line in a chosen directory in your laptop/PC and write a command:
```js
git clone <URL_to_repository>
```
You can copy a link to repository from the page of repo (click "Code" button and later copy a shown link).

2. In a command line type following commands:
```js
myenv\Scripts\activate
python program.py
```
